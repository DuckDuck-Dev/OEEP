# OEEP (Open Edu Evaluation Project)

Welcome to the **Open Edu Evaluation Project**! Our mission is to create a transparent and collaborative platform for evaluating educators and their classes. Whether you're a student, parent, or fellow teacher, our user-friendly interface allows you to share your experiences and insights.

## Features:
- **Teacher Reviews**: Share your thoughts on specific teachers. Was their teaching style engaging? Did they provide helpful feedback? Let the community know!
- **Class Evaluations**: Rate and review individual classes. Was the content relevant? Were assignments well-structured? Your input matters!
- **Public and Private Comments**: Choose whether your feedback is public or private. Public comments help others make informed decisions, while private comments allow for discreet communication.
- **Two-Way Communication**: Professors and teachers can respond to reviews. Engage in constructive conversations and address concerns directly.

2. **Submit Pull Requests**: Help us improve the codebase, fix bugs, or add new features.
